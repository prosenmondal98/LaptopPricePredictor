# Laptop_Price_Predictor
### Overview:
This project not only aims to predict laptop prices based on a set of features and specifications but also provides an interactive web application interface using Streamlit, allowing users to get real-time price estimates for laptops.
### Features:
1. Data Cleaning: Before any modeling or analysis, the raw laptop data was meticulously cleaned, ensuring removal of inconsistencies, duplicates, and handling of missing values.
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Thorough EDA was undertaken to understand the data better. Visualizations were crafted to get insights into the distribution of laptop prices and to understand the relationships between different features.
3. Regression Models: Multiple regression models were explored to predict laptop prices. Their performances were compared to pinpoint the most effective predictive model.
4. Streamlit Web App: Developed an interactive web application using Streamlit, enabling users to input laptop specifications and receive real-time price predictions.
