# Laptop_Price_Predictor
Laptop Price Prediction Project
This repository contains a machine learning project that predicts the prices of laptops based on various features and specifications. The project utilizes a dataset of historical laptop prices and applies regression techniques to build a predictive model.

Project Overview
This project aims to develop a reliable model that can estimate the price of a laptop given its specifications. By analyzing features such as the laptop's brand, processor, memory, storage, graphics card, and other relevant attributes, the model aims to provide accurate price predictions.

Dataset
The project employs a dataset containing information about various laptops, including their specifications and corresponding prices. The dataset is preprocessed and cleaned to ensure the quality of the input data for training the machine learning model.

Machine Learning Techniques
The project utilizes a regression-based approach to predict laptop prices. Several regression algorithms, such as linear regression, decision trees, random forests, or gradient boosting, are implemented and evaluated to determine the best-performing model. Feature selection and engineering techniques are also applied to improve prediction accuracy.

Implementation
The project is implemented using Python programming language and popular libraries such as scikit-learn, pandas, and numpy. Jupyter Notebook is used as the development environment to demonstrate the step-by-step process of data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.

Results and Evaluation
The performance of each model is assessed using appropriate evaluation metrics, including mean squared error (MSE), root mean squared error (RMSE), and R-squared score. The project also provides visualizations, such as scatter plots and regression curves, to analyze the model's performance visually.

How to Use
Instructions for running the project locally are provided in the repository's documentation. Users can clone the repository, install the required dependencies, and execute the provided code to perform laptop price predictions on their own datasets.

Contribution
Contributions to the project, such as bug fixes, enhancements, and additional features, are welcome. Please follow the guidelines outlined in the repository's contributing documentation.
